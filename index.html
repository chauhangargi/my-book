          <p>Sudeep's first book, Few Things Left Unsaid, was published on 10 July 2011. His second book, That's the way we met, was published on 1 July 2012. Soon after the release of his second book, he quit his job at an IT company in 2012 to fully devote his time to writing.[8] He also faced stiff opposition from his family when he decided to turn out into a full-time writer.[9] His first two novels were inspired by his own life. Sudeep was in the habit of penning a diary which consisted of his college experiences and memories.[10] He received "Youth achievers" award in August 2013 for writing three bestselling novels back to back and for being one of the highest selling romance author in India. His debut novel Few Things Left Unsaid is likely going to be adopted for Marathi feature film in 2016.</p>
